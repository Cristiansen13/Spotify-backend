# Project Title

For this project, I have implemented an application similar in functionality to Spotify, simulating various user actions. Now, with added features related to monetization and user engagement details on our platform. Additionally, the project involves the ability to create playlists based on user preferences or preferences of fans of a specific artist. Users will also receive notifications from the platform about new additions.

## Introduction

GlobalWaves isn't just about music; it's a comprehensive ecosystem where users can engage with their favorite artists, discover new content, and contribute to the success of musicians. From personalized statistics that reflect individual listening habits to a monetization system that ensures artists are fairly compensated for their work, GlobalWaves aims to redefine the music streaming experience.

## Design Patterns

[Describe the design patterns used in your project. Provide context on why each pattern was chosen and how it contributes to the project's architecture.]

1. **Singleton Pattern:**
  - Used in `module1/class1.py` to ensure a single instance of a class.

2. **Factory Method Pattern:**
  - Implemented in `module2/class3.py` for creating objects without specifying their exact classes.

3. **Observer Pattern:**
  - Utilized in `module2/class4.py` for implementing a publish-subscribe mechanism.
